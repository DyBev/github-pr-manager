# github-pr-manager

## Current Goal

- Create a small typescript based program to:
    - Retrieve any open PR for a given OWNER and a given REPOSITORY
        - Format them in a manner where in which the output could be pasted into slack

## Reason

- I work in a team where we have multiple repositories with multiple PRs open
- Github notifications and PR page isn't always accurate with what PRs are currently open
- Has created an issue where some PRs will be slow to get the neccessary approvals
